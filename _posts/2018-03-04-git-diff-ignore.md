# Implement ignore function for git diff

##  1.Set git-diff driver
 
  run `git config diff.nodiff.command /usr/bin/true` in the root of repository.

## 2.Set git attributes
  As bellow:

```
*.md  diff=nodiff
*.log diff=nodiff
```
  
  The grammer is same as *.gitignore* file,and it make *git diff* ignore the files matched.
